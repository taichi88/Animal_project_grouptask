What was your motivation why i write this code is the Tasks given to me during studyind 
This program is written in python 3. 

The main purpose is to illustrate 
-  concepts of OOP :
    - abstraction,
    - inheritance, (Single, Multiple, multilevel, hierarchical),
    - polymorphism,
    - encapsulation. 
- Access Modifiers:
    - Public,
    - private,
    - protected
-  accessors and mutators
    -  getter 
    -  setter

when you run this code you should fill some additional information in CONSOLE and the programs gives you output depending on the information you provide. 
 in the case if you want to change specific data in the code you must enter the name of the creator (for example NIKA) and then it will be gone throught validation
 and gives you permision to change, but if you enter the wrong name the validation will denies you to change specific data.
